4/9/14: Total time spent - 1.5 hour
	Started working on the project by completing deliverable one. Exciting. Oh, I'm keeping a journal on top of the timesheet. Wheee. I never thought I'd actually get to work on something even vaguely Touhou related on an academic project. This is exciting!

4/10/14: Total time spent - 1.5 hour
	Working on file I/O and config/file verification to make sure the files we're reading from aren't like, broken. So exciting. I haven't done file I/O in a bit so this was pretty fun unrusting my brain.

4/10/14: Total time spent - 1 hour
	Finally started working on actual graphics and whatnot. Mostly reading docs and tutorials on the web, but some coding as well. Pygame is definitely much different than tkinter so it's going to take a bit to get used to rethinking how things will work

4/10/14 - Later: Total time spent - 2.5 hours
	Agh, menus. Also, getting some skeleton structures of the backend coded up in terms of how the game will handle different states such as while on the menu, playing, option screen, etc.
	HOLY SHIT I GOT SPRITES WORKING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	HOLY SHIT I GOT HIGHLIGHTED BUTTONS AND HIGHLIGHTED SCROLLING WORKING AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
	Oh, system independant filepaths. Wheeee

4/11/14: Total time spent - 3 hour
	SOUNDS WHEEEEE
	Menu scrolling and selecting new interfaces
	Trying to get game "start" working with animated sprites - WORKS
	Made helper funcs for music playing to allow ease of changing tracks
	AAAHHHH I GOT MY CHARACTER TO MOVE AND SHOOT AND AFASDFAS (now to worry about hitbox detection *sigh*)

4/12/14: Total time spent - 4.5 hour
	Reworked bullet sprite to account for angles and to travel accordingly to the angles
	Created a helper func that will clear any bullets off-screen when called. This is going to be super useful.
	Got enemy sprites and collision detection working
	Enemies can shoot randomly now!
	Enemy shots aim towards player (math.atan seems to be a bit inaccurate though.)
	Started working on the "homing amulet" shot-type. Doesn't work at all atm. Lol. *cries in corner*

4/13/14: Total time spent - 1 hour
	Homing amulets suck.

4/14/14: Total time spent - 1 hour
	Aaaa 41414. Started actually making the GUI

4/15/14: Total time spent - 2 hour
	AAAA GOT THE FUCKING AMULETS TO HOME IN CORRECTLY FUCK YOU ATAN RETURNING RADIANS
	Seeming to hit a bit of a roadblock on performance issues. Stupid interpretted languages.

4/19/14: Total time spent - 1 hour
	Oops. Forgot to take note of how long I worked on this the past couple of days. Wheee.

4/20/14: Total time spent - 5 hours
	Reworking stuff to account for power level, shot patterns, minor tweaks in background, adding scores and stuff. Mostly GUI related stuffs
	Added auto-collect line. Should probably work on non-mechanic stuff next. Pause menus, in-game config editing, etc. -an hour later- Nah. More mechanics.

4/21/14: Total time spent - 3 hour
	HOLY FUCK I FIXED THAT STUPID BULLET MOVING IN A GRID BUG YEAH FUCK YOU RECTS, YOU DON'T SUPPORT SUBPIXEL ACCURACY AND ROUND SHIT
	aaaaaaaaaa started working on level pre-rendering and stuff.


4/22/14: Total time spent - 3 hours
	Started working on background, at least the concepts for it. Mostly brainstorming
	Tried to work a bit more on optimization. Pygame sucks.

4/23/14: Total time spent - 3 hours
	Background rendering is going pretty well. Got the tree thing to work.
	Got a gradient overlay for some shitty perception of "depth" with darkness.
	Aaaaaaa I can't get the damn background to align correctly. I hate life.

4/24/14: Total time spent - 2 hours
	Got an actually working "api" sort of thing for level creation. Can actually spawn stuff based off of timing and dynamic enemies

4/25/14: Total time spent - 5 hours
	Continuing working on the level creation. Sprite creation now uses kwargs for even more versatility in options. One thing I'm pretty proud of is that when spawning enemies, I do so on a separate thread with its own timer tick so I can spawn them based on delays I supply to the args. Eg, if I have a list of 10 enemies that I want to spawn at 20 tick intervals, I can supply like [(sprite, 20), (sprite2,20)...] etc and it'll spawn them with the supplied delay arg. Pretty cool, I think.
	Fixed that not-overlapping background lol. Turns out I just can't do math correctly. You'd think a college-level student with a decent math background would be able to do some basic arithmetic correctly.
	More dynamic enemy spawning.
	Started work on curve-based movement using polynomial class from hw9

4/26/14: Total time spent - 4 hours
	Multiple bullet types and enemies. Added a shot pattern as well.
	Changed how sprite deletion works to allow for more flexibility
	Fixed a lot of bugs with level generation
	Added bullet hitboxes cuz buggy
	
4/27/14: Total time spent - 3 hours
	I forgot to take notes again and idr. Wheeee

4/28/14: Total time spent - 5 hours
	Lol finally got a pause menu
	PYTHON SUCKS MY SHOTPATTERNS ARE LITERALLY LIMITED BY HOW SLOW PYTHON IS. FUCK.
	AAAHHHHH MULTITHREADED ANIMATED LOADING SCREEN THAT TOOK WAY LONGER TO FIGURE OUT THAN IT SHOULD HAVE AHAHAHAHA
	Oh, and resizable screens. Maybe I should like... work on a usable option menu... meh.

4/29/14: Total time spent - 1 hour
	ahhhh options menu thing

4/30/14-5/1/14: Total time spent - 18 hours
	Death animation.
	Instructions.
	Played a bit with hitbox detection
	TRYING TO ADD A BOSS NOPE
	Added level text
	Pause menu
	Gameover screen
	More GUI information
	More instructions
	...I have something resembling a boss. Holy shit.
	BOSS DIALOGUE WORKING
	FOUR "SPELLCARDS" FOR BOSS
	GAME WIN SCREEN
	I THINK THIS GAME IS DONE RIGHT ABOUT HERE
